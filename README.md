# Non-Custodial-Bitcoin-Vault

A smart contract system that enhances Bitcoin security through programmable recovery options and timelocked withdrawals, built on the Stacks blockchain.

## üîí Core Concept

The Bitcoin Vault provides an additional security layer for Bitcoin holders by introducing time-delayed withdrawals and multi-tiered access controls. Unlike traditional custodial solutions, users maintain full control of their Bitcoin while gaining protection against theft, ransomware, and compromised keys.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Timelocked Withdrawals
- **Delayed Execution**: Withdrawal requests enter a pending state for 24-72 hours before execution
- **Cooling-off Period**: Provides time to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts
- **Configurable Timelock**: Users can set custom timelock periods based on their security preferences

### 2. Cancellation Function
- **Emergency Brake**: Cancel pending withdrawals during the timelock period
- **Ransomware Protection**: Defend against attackers who gain temporary access to keys
- **User Control**: Only the vault owner can cancel pending withdrawals

### 3. Multi-Tiered Security
- **Initiation Key**: Required to start withdrawal requests
- **Finalization Key**: Different key needed to complete withdrawals after timelock
- **Recovery Options**: Multiple authentication methods for different scenarios
- **Hierarchical Access**: Different permission levels for different operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

1. **Vault Core Contract** (`bitcoin-vault.clar`)
   - Manages vault creation and ownership
   - Handles deposit tracking and withdrawal logic
   - Enforces timelock mechanisms

2. **Security Manager** (`security-manager.clar`) *(Planned)*
   - Multi-signature support
   - Key rotation functionality
   - Emergency recovery procedures

3. **Timelock Controller** (`timelock-controller.clar`) *(Planned)*
   - Configurable delay periods
   - Batch withdrawal processing
   - Advanced scheduling features

### Bitcoin Integration

The vault system integrates with Bitcoin through:
- **Deposit Detection**: Monitors Bitcoin addresses for incoming transactions
- **Withdrawal Execution**: Coordinates with Bitcoin network for outgoing transfers
- **Multi-sig Wallets**: Uses Bitcoin multi-signature addresses for enhanced security
